\cvevent{Gesture Based Presentation Pointer}{Project • Prof Arup Lal Chakraborty • IIT-GN }{Nov '19 - Dec '20}{https://youtu.be/GQc7L0EPPWk}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Created a wireless gesture based presentation pointer using an \textbf{IMU} and the \textbf{NodeMCU} platform.
        \item Additional buttons on the device allow for customizable macros providing greater control during presentations.
        \item Effectively nulled harmful laser rays and improved pointer visibility in large auditoria by circumventing lasers
    \end{itemize}

\cvevent{DailyPic}{Project • IIT-GN }{Feb '19}{ }
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Developed a program that monitors a user's activity spent on the computer and classifies activities (working, leisure, etc.)
    \item The program captures an image at a specified interval and detects the mood using their facial expression
    \item After detection, the captured image along with a report is stored on a Google Sheet at 30-minute intervals
\end{itemize}

\cvevent{Deep Face Tracker for FPS Games}{Project • IIT-GN }{Aug '20}{}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Developed a python script that tracks a users face and converts into in-game head movements for FPS games
        \item Implemented the algorithm using pre-trained head pose detection models and OpenCV
        \item Used Opentrack and UDP packets to convert face detection into game movements
        \item Developed a mobile variant of the same which uses the Firebase ML kit to find the orientation of the head in 3D space
    \end{itemize}

\cvevent{Walk Easy: Redesigned Crutches}{Project • Prof Manasi Kanetkar • IIT-GN }{Oct '19 - Nov '19}{asdf}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Redesigned traditional crutches to fix issues such as chronic pain \& inability to climb stairs
        \item Improved support and ease of use by reducing pressure points. Unique mechanisms allow users to climb stairs easily
        \item Demonstrated the product at the Design Competition (results yet to be announced) conducted at IIT-GN in Jan 2020.
    \end{itemize}

\cvevent{HydroBike}{Project • Prof Madhu Vadali • IIT-GN }{Feb '19 - Apr '19}{}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Designed a modified quadricycle which assisted in rapidly drawing water from deep wells in rural areas
    \item Built a simplified design by joining 2 cycles using manufacturing processes such as fitting, welding, lathing and drilling
    \item Tested the prototype by participating in a quadricycle race on a multi-terrain, 2km long race track
\end{itemize}
