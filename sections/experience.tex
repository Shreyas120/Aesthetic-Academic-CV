\cvevent{Graduate Research Assistant}{AirLab • CMU}{Jan '24 - Present}{}
{
\begin{itemize}
        \item Conducting research under Prof. Wenshan Wang on a \textbf{foundation model} for \textbf{multimodal perception} systems (LiDAR, RGB-D, fisheye, thermal, event-cameras, etc.); developing an \textbf{end-to-end DL} framework for robust feature detection \& matching across modalities.
    \end{itemize}
}

\cvevent{Robotics Software Assistant}{BioRobotics Lab • CMU}{Dec '23 - Present}{}
{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Working on the \textbf{VILL-SLAM} software stack for pipe inspection robots - dense 3D RGB-D reconstruction inside constrained environments.
        \item Refactoring the codebase for maintainability \& re-usability across products; migrating the repository from \textbf{ROS1 to ROS2}.
    \end{itemize}
}


\cvevent{Localization Software Intern}{Nissan Advanced Technology Center • Sunnyvale, USA}{May '23 - Aug '23}{}
{
\begin{itemize}
        \item Developed a cloud-based state estimation stack in \textbf{C++11} using delayed inputs from a multi-object tracker \& vehicle-CAN (odometry, inertial, GPS) using \textbf{iSAM2 fixed-lag smoother} to achieve mean localization accuracies of \textbf{50cm} in position \& \textbf{0.5\degree} in heading.
        \item Modelled sensor noise with \textbf{OxTS GNSS} \& tuned \textbf{robust estimators} for outlier rejection; developed \textbf{custom factors} for use with GTSAM.

\cvevent{Operations Intern - Automation Services}{Amazon • Bangalore, IN}{Jan '21 - Jul '21}{}
{    \begin{itemize}
        \item Generated over 150 data-driven combinatorial rules to extend \textbf{automated decision-making} for ad content moderation to auto-reject \textbf{400k} inappropriate MoM with \textbf{99.7\% precision}, \textbf{saving 89 days} of human bandwidth \textbf{MoM} from the automation gain.
        \item Trained a \textbf{multi-class classification} model using xgBoost that takes a final moderation decision on an ad, through indirect \textbf{fusion} of inputs from numerous upstream signals; improved the AUC of the existing model by \textbf{625bps} through \textbf{feature engineering}.
